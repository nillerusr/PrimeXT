Modern SDK for Xash3D engine, with extended physics (using PhysX), improved graphics (dynamic lighting with shadows, HDR, cubemap/screen-space reflections, PBR support, parallax-mapping, bloom, color correction, SSAO, etc). 
Based on XashXT and Spirit Of Half-Life and includes all features and entities from it.  
At this time, project in primal state: it somehow works, but there is a lot of thing to fix/implement next.  
We need interested people to work on this SDK with us! Main goals of this project is:
- Optimizing world rendering as much as possible
- Implementing HDR rendering pipeline
- Updating PhysX headers to modern SDK version
- Implementing particle engine, something like in Source Engine
- Cross-platform (now Windows and Linux supported, Android in plans)
- Writing actual documentation, translating it to English (in process)
- Code refactoring

Full list of project goals you can see on documetation site, it's available [here](https://snmetamorph.github.io/PrimeXT/), but now it's still in progress. 
Therefore, you can tell suggestion about what should be documented at first.  
You can discuss with community members and ask questions in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/BxQUMUescJ) server.

## Installation
Testing builds available for everybody. Detailed installation guide you can read on our documentation site: available on [english](https://snmetamorph.github.io/PrimeXT/docs/eng/installation) and [russian](https://snmetamorph.github.io/PrimeXT/docs/rus/installation).

## Building
> NOTE: Never download sources from GitHub manually, because it doesn't include external depedencies, you SHOULD use Git clone instead.
1) Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for cloning project
2) Clone this repository: enter these commands to Git console
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SNMetamorph/PrimeXT.git
cd PrimeXT
```
Next steps will be vary according to your development environment and tools.
### Windows (using Visual Studio)
3) Open cloned repository directory as CMake folder with Visual Studio (project tested with VS2019, but more later version will works also)<br>
4) Select desired build configuration, usually it's `x86-Debug`
5) In `Build` menu select `Build solution`, or you can use `Ctrl+Shift+B` hotkey instead. Wait for completion.
6) Compiled binaries locates in `build\x\bin` and `build\x\devkit`, where `x` is your build configuration name
### Linux (using CMake)
3) Install some build depedencies: `sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib cmake`
4) Prepare build environment and configure project
```
cmake -E make_directory ./build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_UTILS=OFF -DENABLE_PHYSX=OFF
```
5) Build project: `cmake --build . --config Debug`
6) Compiled binaries will be located in `build` and `build\primext\bin` directories
